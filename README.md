# My GNU/Linux Project

The purpose of this project is to improve my profiency on the GNU/Linux computer operating system by continuously taking notes
on my GNU/Linux experiences.

For the sake of brevity, I refer to GNU/Linux as Linux in my notes.
These notes were created, and are maintained, using the [Zim Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/).

**Thank for for visiting this project!!!**
