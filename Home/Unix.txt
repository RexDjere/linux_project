What is Unix?
Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, 
whose development started in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.

What was the goal of Unix's creators?
Unix was originally meant to be a convenient platform for programmers developing software
to be run on it and on other systems, rather than for non-programmers.	[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix|[ref 1]]]
