What is the purpose of chmod?
Chmod is a Linux command that lets you change file permissions.	[[https://www.linux.org/threads/file-permissions-chmod.4124/|[ref 1]]]

You have a file called my_c_plus_plus_file.cpp.
How would you use chmod to give the file the following permissions?
* you, the user, can read, write, and execute the file.
* members of your group can read and execute the file.
* others can only read the file.

chmod u=rwx, g=rx, o=r my_c_plus_plus_file.cpp
