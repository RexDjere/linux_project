How were physical disks divided in the original Unix file system?
In the original Unix file system, Unix divided physical disks into logical units called partitions.	[[https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~rek/DCS/D04/UnixFileSystems.html|[ref 1]]]
Each partition is a standalone file system.
We will use the term "file system =" when referring to a single partition.

Each filesystem contains what?	[[https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~rek/DCS/D04/UnixFileSystems.html|[ref 1]]]
* a boot block
* a super block
* a linear array of inodes (short for "index nodes")
* data blocks containing the actual contents of files

What is an inode?
An [[+inode]] is the "handle" to a file and contains the following information:	[[https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~rek/DCS/D04/UnixFileSystems.html|[ref 1]]]
* file ownership indication
* file type
* file access permissions
* time of last access
* number of links to the file
* pointers 
* size
